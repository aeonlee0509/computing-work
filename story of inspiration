The cold wind blew. 
milo was awaken by the swoosh of wind that banged against the windows.
she saw the most monstrous person in the world. 
It was happy. 
milo shivered at the sight of happy, the one who everyone feared, 
the person who thought Bill Gates was the inventor of Apple.

happy wore transparent spectacles , the most powerful one in the world. 
everyone feared happy's lack of knowledge and brainless mind who doesnt know anything. 

as happy threatens milo to give her money,
milo:sighs
milo:"i dont have money."
milo:"take my life."

and there happy stood, "yep, that didnt work out."
happy:sighs
happy:when will milo wish me happy birthday?
happy:sighs
happy:sighs
happy:sighs
happy:sighs
happy:sighs

happy:is milo still asleep?
apparently milo isnt......
